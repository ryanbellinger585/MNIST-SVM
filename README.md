# MNIST-SVM
Creating SVMs from scratch and training on the MNIST digits dataset.

Utilizing a perceptron algorithm with a linear kernel and an 1-norm soft margin. Trains the Support Vector Machines on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. Uses cross validation to tune the hyperparameter that controls the tradeoff between the margin size and error allowed in the model.
